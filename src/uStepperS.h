* @brief      Function prototypes and definitions for the uStepper S library
*
*             This file contains class and function prototypes for the library,
*             as well as necessary constants and global variables.
*
* @author     Thomas Hørring Olsen (thomas@ustepper.com)
*
*	\mainpage Arduino library for the uStepper S Board
*	
*	This is the uStepper S Arduino library, providing software functions for the different features of the uStepper S board.
*
*	\par Features
*	The uStepper S library contains the following features:
*
*	- Dropin feature for applications like 3D printers
*	- Closed loop PID position controller
*	- Control of RC servo motors
*	- Measure the current position of the shaft (absolute, multiple revolutions)
*	- Measure the current speed of the motor 
*	- Stall detection for use in e.g. limit detection functionality 
*	
*	The library uses timer one in order to function properly, meaning that unless the user of this library
*	can accept the loss of some functionality, this timer is unavailable and the registers associated with these timers
*	should not be reconfigured.
*
*	Timer one is used for sampling the encoder in order to provide the ability to keep track of both the current speed and the
*	angle moved since the board was reset (or a new home position was configured). Also the drop-in features missed step detection and 
*	correction is done in this timer. 
*	
*	\par EEPROM Usage information
*	\warning
*	\warning Please be aware that the uStepper uses the EEPROM to store settings related to the Dropin application.
*	\warning If you are not using this, then this has no impact for your application, and you can ignore this section !
*	\warning
*	\warning EEPROM address 0 to 15 contains the different settings for dropin. If your application uses the EEPROM,
*	\warning Please use another location than these !
*
*	\par Installation
*	To install the uStepper S library into the Arduino IDE, perform the following steps:
*
*	- Go to Sketch->Include Libraries->Manage Libraries... in the arduino IDE
*	- Search for "uStepper S", in the top right corner of the "Library Manager" window
*	- Install uStepper S library 
*	
*	The library is tested with Arduino IDE 1.8.8
*	
*	\warning MAC users should be aware, that OSX does NOT include SILABS VCP drivers, needed to upload sketches to the uStepper S, by default. This driver should be 
*	downloaded and installed from SILABS's website:
*	\warning https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
*	\warning             The uStepper S should NOT be connected to the USB port while installing this driver !
*	\warning This is not (commonly) a problem for windows/linux users, as these drivers are most often already included in the OS

*
*	\par To do list
*	- Clean out in unused variables
*	- Update comments
*
*	\par Known Bugs
*	- does not properly release motor in dropin mode
*
*	\author Thomas Hørring Olsen (thomas@ustepper.com)
*	\par Change Log
*	\version 1.0.1:
*	- Fixed bug in functions to set acceleration and deceleration
*	- moved a couple of functions in uStepperDriver.h from public to protected section of class
*	- added documentation
*	\version 1.0.0:
*	- Bug fixes
*	- New Dropin PID code
*	- Added dropin CLI interface
*	- Fixed stall detection, and added user sensitivity parameter
